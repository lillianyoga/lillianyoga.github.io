								<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized 
									its many benefits. She fell in love with the practice and the 
									way it enhanced her other physical activities, such as 
									mountaineering, rock and ice climbing, running, and tennis. She 
									completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan.
									She currently has a E-RYT 500 Yoga Alliance designation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillianâ€™s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced,
									safe, and accessible to all. She believes that a mindful yoga 
									practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her studio 
									feeling stronger, calmer, and more connected to the world 
									around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice, and regularly 
									plays tennis. She is the treasurer of <a href="https://www.thepracticecoalition.org/">
									The Practice Coalition</a>, a non-profit dedicated to providing trauma-informed yoga
									and to taking care of the teachers who offer it. 
									She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering.

								<h3>Class Descriptions</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Bliss Yoga.</i> A dynamic yet gentle style of hatha yoga that emphasizes body awareness
									and coordinating movement with breath.  Take time to stretch tight muscles plus relax...
									you deserve it!
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Vinyasa.</i> This moderately paced vinyasa flow class is suited for most, 
									from those who have only recently hit the mat to the most advanced of practitioners.
									Teachers will offer modifications that allow students to choose a more beginning or 
									advanced practice according to their needs as well as mindful suggestions on alignment 
									and technique. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Sunrise Salutations.</i> Rise and shine, morning glory and wake up to the power of 
									the sun. Skip the caffeine and jump-start your day with a class that builds strength 
									and flexiblity with every pose.
				        			</p>
								<p>
									<i>Trauma-Informed Yoga.</i> Trauma can leave the body feeling dis-regulated and unsafe. 
									Trauma-informed yoga classes help people explore and identify 
									resources for self-regulation. This class invites you to experience breath and movement 
									in a non-threatening and nurturing environment. 
									Each class combines yoga postures and breathing techniques in a balanced sequence.	
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Yoga Body Sculpt.</i> A strength-building Vinyasa flow class that focuses on
									sculpting your buns and thighs while flattening your belly and strengthening your core.

									Join fellow yogi <a href="https://www.shanekamayoga.com/" target="_blank">Shane Allen</a> 
									and me at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/latiendadelaflorida/" target="_blank">this beautiful location</a> 
									in a coffee growing region of Colombia, Sunday to Saturday, March 12-18, 2023. 
								</p>

									Every day starts with a yoga class followed by brunch. 
									In the afternoons, we will go coffee tasting, hike, tour Medellin, visit hot springs, and dive deep into our yoga practice.
									The itinerary includes pranayama, meditation, yoga philosophy, vinyasa, iyengar, and meridian yoga classes, yet also 
									leaves plenty of time to laze at the pool, soak in the hot tub, and just be. 
									We will have the whole place to ourselves. Food will be provided by a local chef on premises. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Price includes room, all meals (including a restaurant dinner in Medellin one night), transportation to and from the Medellin airport,
									yoga, and all excursions. Airfare not included. Price for a private room: $1750; for shared accommodation: $1250. 
								</p>
								<p>
									For more information, or to sign up, please <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>. 
									Our last retreat sold out very quickly, so don't delay!
