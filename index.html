								<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized 
									its many benefits. She fell in love with the practice and the 
									way it enhanced her other physical activities, such as 
									mountaineering, rock and ice climbing, running, and tennis. She 
									completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillian’s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced,
									safe, and accessible to all. She believes that a mindful yoga 
									practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her studio 
									feeling stronger, calmer, and more connected to the world 
									around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice, and regularly 
									plays tennis. She is the treasurer of
									The Practice Coalition, a non-profit dedicated to providing trauma-informed yoga
									and to taking care of the teachers who offer it.

								<h3>Class Descriptions</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Chair Yoga.</i> This gentler form of yoga is practiced sitting on
									a chair or using a chair for support during standing poses.  Chair
									yoga helps increase flexibility, lung capacity, circulation and 
									strength, improves balance, and relieves stress.  The class 
									incorporates breathing exercises, stretching, yoga postures, 
									and final relaxation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Mat / Meditation.</i> An open level vinyasa class followed by a 
									shorter guided meditation. The vinyasa flow aims to prime your 
									body and mind for the meditation practice.  Meditation helps 
									with stress reduction, relaxation, awareness and focus. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Open Level Vinyasa.</i> Expect to move with your breath and focus 
									your attention; this well-balanced flow class will get you
									out of your head and into your body and your breath. Modifications 
									will be offered for both beginners and advanced practitioners. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Trauma-Informed Yoga.</i> Trauma can leave the body feeling dis-regulated and unsafe. 
									Trauma-informed yoga classes help people explore and identify 
									resources for self-regulation. This class invites you to experience breath and movement 
									in a non-threatening and nurturing environment. 
									Each class combines yoga postures and breathing techniques in a balanced sequence.	
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Yoga Nidra / Meditation.</i> Some weeks, we will practice Yoga Nidra, and other
									weeks, we will do guided meditation. Yoga Nidra is the practice and art of Yogic Sleep. 
									Yoda Nidra guides you through a detailed sleep meditation
									that allows your mind and body to slip into a deep state of relaxation.
									Meditation helps with stress reduction, relaxation, awareness and focus.
