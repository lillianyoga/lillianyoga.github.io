									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized 
									its many benefits. She fell in love with the practice and the 
									way it enhanced her other physical activities, such as 
									mountaineering, rock and ice climbing, running, and tennis. She 
									completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan.
									She currently has a E-RYT 200, RYT 500 Yoga Alliance designation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillian’s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced,
									safe, and accessible to all. She believes that a mindful yoga 
									practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her studio 
									feeling stronger, calmer, and more connected to the world 
									around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice, and regularly 
									plays tennis. She is the treasurer of <a href="https://www.thepracticecoalition.org/">
									The Practice Coalition</a>, a non-profit dedicated to providing trauma-informed yoga
									and to taking care of the teachers who offer it. 
									She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering.

								<h3>Class Descriptions</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Bliss Yoga.</i> A dynamic yet gentle style of hatha yoga that emphasizes body awareness
									and coordinating movement with breath.  Take time to stretch tight muscles plus relax...
									you deserve it!
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Hatha Flow.</i> Yoga that integrates posture, breathing exercises, relaxation and meditation 
									to harmonize you on every level - body, mind and spirit. A delicious, mindful and moving class. 
									All levels welcome.
								</p>	
								<p>
									<i>Open Level Vinyasa.</i> This moderately paced vinyasa flow class is suited for most, 
									from those who have only recently hit the mat to the most advanced of practitioners.
									Teachers will offer modifications that allow students to choose a more beginning or 
									advanced practice according to their needs as well as mindful suggestions on alignment 
									and technique. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Power Hour.</i> A shortened version of the core Center Yoga class. Center Yoga is a 
									modern interpretation of classical yoga — matching breath with movement, mastery through 
									repetition and held poses, and the use of props in the belief that yoga is for all bodies.
									Get a complete practice in one hour and leave feeling refreshed, revitalized and 
									ready for the rest of your day.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Sunrise Salutations.</i> Rise and shine, morning glory and wake up to the power of 
									the sun. Skip the caffeine and jump-start your day with a class that builds strength 
									and flexiblity with every pose.
				        			</p>
								<p>
									<i>Trauma-Informed Yoga.</i> Trauma can leave the body feeling dis-regulated and unsafe. 
									Trauma-informed yoga classes help people explore and identify 
									resources for self-regulation. This class invites you to experience breath and movement 
									in a non-threatening and nurturing environment. 
									Each class combines yoga postures and breathing techniques in a balanced sequence.	
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Yoga Body Sculpt.</i> A strength-building Vinyasa flow class that focuses on
									sculpting your buns and thighs while flattening your belly and strengthening your core.
