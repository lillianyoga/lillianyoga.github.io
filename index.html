								<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized its many benefits. 
									She fell in love with the practice and the way it enhanced her life both physically 
									and mentally. She completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan. 
									She currently has a E-RYT 500 Yoga Alliance designation. 
									In 2024, she became a certfiied Pilates teacher as well, training with Patricia Pinto at Lila Flow, 
									and appreciates how the two disciplines inform and enhance each other.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillianâ€™s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced, safe, and accessible to all. 
									She believes that a mindful yoga practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her classes feeling stronger, calmer, 
									and more connected to the world around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven Summits. 
									She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice. 
									She is the treasurer of <a href="https://www.thepracticecoalition.org/">
									The Practice Coalition</a>, a non-profit dedicated to providing yoga for trauma
									to survivors of domestic and sexual violence and to taking care of the teachers who offer it. 
									She is also the co-founder, with <a href="https://www.shanekamayoga.com/">
									Shane Allen</a>, of <a href="https://humblewarrior.studio/#">Humble Warrior</a>, 
									through which she co-organizes and co-leads retreats and teacher trainings around the globe. 
									She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering, and in a former life, worked as an application software developer
									and project manager in the financial industry.

								<h3>Class Descriptions</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Fundamentals.</i> This class introduces students to the basics of yoga, including breathing, poses, and alignment. 
									Fundamentals is designed for beginners and those looking to deepen their understanding of yoga.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Iyengar.</i> Iyengar focuses on alignment. This unique style of yoga is not a flow. 
									This is a class to explore poses to gain a deeper understanding of anatomy and the benefits of each posture. 
									Suitable for all levels, this is a way to get to know the yoga poses on a more intimate level.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Pilasana</i> Pilasana fuses elements of modern Pilates and yoga. Combining core strengthening exercises 
									alongside stretching, flexibility & mobility work, Pilasana makes for a powerful toning workout that will 
									get your blood pumping while leaving you feeling relaxed and refreshed.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Vinyasa.</i> Vinyasa is a creative form of yoga where poses are linked together with the breath in a flowing sequence.
									Open to all practioners; modifications will be offered that allow students to choose a more beginning or 
									advanced practice according to their needs as well as mindful suggestions on alignment and technique.
