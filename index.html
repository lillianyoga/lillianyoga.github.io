								<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized 
									its many benefits. She fell in love with the practice and the 
									way it enhanced her other physical activities, such as 
									mountaineering, rock and ice climbing, running, and tennis. She 
									completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillianâ€™s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced,
									safe, and accessible to all. She believes that a mindful yoga 
									practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her studio 
									feeling stronger, calmer, and more connected to the world 
									around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice, and regularly 
									plays tennis. Likewise, she is a supporter and collector of 
									the arts, and enjoys theater, dance and travel.

								<p>
									Lillian took her first yoga class in 1980, and throughout the 
									ensuing years, she has practiced many different styles of yoga, 
									including vinyasa, iyengar, ashtanga, yin, integral, power, 
									and restorative.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian chose to bring her love of yoga to the world 
									and enrolled in the 200 Hour RYT Teacher Training at Yoga Vida 
									in New York. She is continuing her training and will complete 
									her 300 Hour RYT Teacher Training in 2020, following an 
									extended study of the Bhagavad Gita in Vrindavan, India.
								</p>
								<p>
									An avid mountain climber and competitive athlete, Lillian 
									enjoys the phyical aspects of yoga and can provide a rigourous
									training session. However, her classes are very adaptable and 
									appropriate for yogis of all experience levels. From nearly four
									decades of practice, Lillian has learned to modify her practice
									with age. She also specializes in trauma-informed yoga and can 
									impart a restorative and respectful session.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillian can be found in yoga studios and gyms around New York 
									City, and provides individual and small group sessions, as well.
