								<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized 
									its many benefits. She fell in love with the practice and the 
									way it enhanced her other physical activities, such as 
									mountaineering, rock and ice climbing, running, and tennis. She 
									completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillian’s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced,
									safe, and accessible to all. She believes that a mindful yoga 
									practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her studio 
									feeling stronger, calmer, and more connected to the world 
									around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice, and regularly 
									plays tennis. Likewise, she is a supporter and collector of 
									the arts, and enjoys theater, dance and travel.

										sessions, both online and in-person. In-person classes take place outdoors at Central Park.
										Private sessions can take place in your home, at the beU studio, outdoors in one of the city's greenspaces, or on zoom. For more information,

								<h3>Class Descriptions</h3>
								<p>
									<i>Chair Yoga.</i> This gentler form of yoga is practiced sitting on
									a chair or using a chair for support during standing poses.  Chair
									yoga helps increase flexibility, lung capacity, circulation and 
									strength, improves balance, and relieves stress.  The class 
									incorporates breathing exercises, stretching, yoga postures, 
									and final relaxation.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Hatha Yoga.</i> This class is designed to align and calm your body, mind, and spirit in preparation for meditation. Its name comes from the
									Sanskrit words “sun” (ha) and “moon” (tha), the yoga of balance. It encourages to explore the balance within ourselves,
									raising our consciousness. A powerful way to self-transformation, it brings attention to the even flow of breath and
									alignment of the body so energy can flow freely. By its nature, Hatha is a gentle, basic, slower-paced yoga with minimal
									flows between poses, making it ideal for beginners. While you may not sweat much, you’ll likely feel longer, looser and
									more relaxed after practice.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Mat / Meditation.</i> An open level vinyasa class followed by a 
									shorter guided meditation. The vinyasa flow aims to prime your 
									body and mind for the meditation practice.  Meditation helps 
									with stress reduction, relaxation, awareness and focus. Gentle
									yet invigorating, this balanced class is the perfect way to
									end your week.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Open Level Vinyasa.</i> Expect to move with your breath and focus 
									your attention; this well-balanced flow class will get you
									out of your head and into your body and your breath. Modifications 
									will be offered for both beginners and advanced
									practitioners. All welcome.
								</p>
								<p>
									<i>Yoga Nidra / Meditation.</i> Some weeks, we will practice Yoga Nidra, and other
									weeks, we will do guided meditation. Yoga Nidra is the practice and art of Yogic Sleep. 
									In this class you will be guided through a detailed sleep meditation
									that will allow your mind and body to slip into a deep state of relaxation.
									Meditation helps with stress reduction, relaxation, awareness and focus.
